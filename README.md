Code to accompany our paper, "Estimating adult death rates from sibling histories: A network approach" [arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12000)

Note: in order to run this code, you'll need to register with the Demographic and Health Surveys to download the Malawi 2000 DHS dataset.

You'll also need to install some packages from github. The `DESCRIPTION` file included in this
repository has a description of the files you need. The packages from CRAN are the ones for
2020-11-16.

There is also a Dockerfile in `.binder/Dockerfile`.
